They don’t understand :is(), :where(), :has(), or CSS nesting. This tool does — because it was built from scratch to handle the future of CSS today.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Traditional calculators rely on outdated libraries that haven’t been updated in years. They return wrong values for modern selectors and crash on valid syntax. This creates false confidence — you think your CSS is clean when it’s actually full of hidden problems.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Why Libraries vs Reality</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Many popular specificity tools use libraries from 2018 or earlier. They were built before :is() existed and before nesting was standardized. When faced with :is(.card, .alert):hover, they either throw errors or return zero.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">This tool uses a hand-written, zero-dependency parser specifically designed for 2025 CSS. It correctly calculates specificity even for the most complex modern selectors.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">How It Actually Works</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">The engine follows the official CSS Cascading and Inheritance Level 4 specification. It counts inline styles, IDs, classes, attributes, pseudo-classes, elements, and pseudo-elements exactly as browsers do — including the special rules for :is(), :where(), and :has().</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">When you wrap selectors in :where(), the specificity becomes zero for that wrapper. When you use :is(), it inherits the highest specificity of its arguments. These rules are complex — but implemented perfectly here.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">No External Dependencies</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Every other tool pulls in heavy parsers with Node.js dependencies that cause warnings in the browser. This tool has none. The calculation happens entirely in your browser with pure JavaScript, ensuring speed, privacy, and accuracy.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">The result? Lightning-fast feedback, no network requests, and results you can trust — even with the most cutting-edge CSS syntax.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">This commitment to accuracy is why developers trust this tool with production codebases. When it flags a selector as dangerous, you know it’s right.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-jo8es1">In a world of half-working tools, precision matters. This one gets it right.</p></article></div>');function A(h){var e=T();w("jo8es1",u=>{var a=j(),y=f(m(a),6);s(4),r(()=>n(y,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post7`)),v(()=>{g.title="How This Tool Calculates Specificity (And Why It’s More Accurate) | Blog"}),o(u,a)});var t=i(e),d=i(t);s(4),l(t),s(2),l(e),r(()=>n(d,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),o(h,e)}export{A as component,k as universal};
