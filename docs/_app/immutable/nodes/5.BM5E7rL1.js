You need to change the color of a button, and suddenly you’re writing even longer selectors or reaching for the dreaded !important just to make something work. The root cause? High specificity.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">When you write selectors like #header .nav ul li a or body.home .main-content .card .title, you’re not just targeting an element — you’re locking it down. These selectors have extremely high priority in the cascade, which means almost nothing can override them without fighting back with even more specificity.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">The Real-World Consequences</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">In large teams or long-lived projects, high specificity creates a cascade arms race. One developer uses an ID to style a button. Another can’t override it with a class, so they add another ID. Soon, every style change requires finding and updating multiple deeply nested selectors scattered across files.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Worse, it breaks reusability. A beautifully styled component that works perfectly on the homepage — but when moved to a sidebar, it refuses to adapt because its original selector was too specific to the context.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">The Hidden Performance Cost</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">While not dramatic, highly specific selectors are slower for browsers to match. More importantly, they prevent modern optimization techniques like CSS containment and style sharing between components.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The worst offender is the ID selector. With a specificity of 1,0,0,0, it beats almost everything except inline styles and !important. This single choice often forces entire teams into bad patterns for years.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Breaking the Cycle</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The solution starts with awareness. By understanding how specificity actually works — and seeing it measured in real time — developers naturally begin writing simpler, more flexible selectors.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Tools that highlight high-specificity patterns make the problem visible. When you can see that a simple .button has become #page .content .card .button-primary, the need for change becomes obvious.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Lower specificity doesn’t mean less power. It means more control, better maintainability, and styles that naturally flow with the cascade instead of fighting against it.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1tq17n3">Your future self — and every developer who touches your code — will thank you for choosing simplicity over precision.</p></article></div>');function x(h){var e=S();b("1tq17n3",d=>{var a=q(),y=g(u(a),6);t(4),o(()=>l(y,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post1`)),f(()=>{v.title="Why High Specificity Is Killing Your CSS | Blog"}),i(d,a)});var s=n(e),m=n(s);t(4),r(s),t(2),r(e),o(()=>l(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),i(h,e)}export{x as component,j as universal};
